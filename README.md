# CCNA 200-301 Complete Course Notes

This is my repository of my personal notes taken during Jeremy's IT Lab Complete CCNA 200-300 course.
Each "Day" is broken down into individual chapters.

I've also created a separate custom [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Im6GYaSno&list=PLeKkafR2n05H0FZNgcz2z56pMPooaskFr) of just the Course Labs for easy access.

I also highly recommend his second set of [older labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgcGcrLKu1A&list=PLxbwE86jKRgMQ4HTuaJ7yQgA2BoNwY9ct) for practice during and after finishing the course, for review.

[Jeremy's MEGA Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p7-MluKAgE&list=PLeKkafR2n05G-C6sd19ZMKq7et__aDR1S) encompasses everything you will learn in his CCNA course
