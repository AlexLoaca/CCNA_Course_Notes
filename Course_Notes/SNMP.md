# 40. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)

SNMP OVERVIEW

- SNMP is an INDUSTRY-STANDARD FRAMEWORK and PROTOCOL that was originally released in 1988

These RFCs make up SNMPv1 (Do not need to memorize)

<aside>
üí° RFC 1065 - Structure and identification of management information for TCP/IP based internets

RFC 1066 - Management information base for network management of TCP/IP based internets

RFC 1067 - A simple network management protocol

</aside>

- Don‚Äôt let the ‚ÄòSimple‚Äô in the name fool you !
- SNMP can be used to monitor the STATUS of DEVICES, make CONFIGURATION CHANGES, etc.
- There are TWO MAIN TYPES of DEVICES in SNMP:
    - MANAGED DEVICES
        - These are the DEVICES being managed using SNMP
            - Ex: ROUTERS, SWITCHES
    - NETWORK MANAGEMENT STATION (NMS)
        - The DEVICE / DEVICES managing the MANAGED DEVICES
        - THIS is the SNMP ‚ÄòSERVER‚Äô

SNMP OIDs

- SNMP Object IDs are ORGANIZED in a HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE

SNMP VERSIONS

- Many versions of SNMP have been proposed/developed, however, only three major versions have achieved wide-spread use:

- **SNMPv1**
    - The ORIGINAL version of SNMP
- **SNMPv2c**
    - Allows the NMS to retrieve LARGE AMOUNTS of information in a SINGLE REQUEST, so it is more efficient
    - ‚Äòc‚Äô refers to the ‚Äòcommunity strings‚Äô used as PASSWORDS in SNMPv1, removed from SNMPv2, and then added BACK for SNMPv2
- **SNMPv3**
    - A much more SECURE version of SNMP that supports STRONG ENCRYPTION and AUTHENTICATION.

SNMP MESSAGES

![image](https://github.com/psaumur/CCNA/assets/106411237/25b15c81-931a-41a6-8033-dff07bfb5f15)

1) SNMP READ

2) SMNP WRITE



3) SNMP NOTIFICATION



SNMP AGENT listens for MESSAGES on UDP Port 161

SNMP MANAGER listens for MESSAGES on UDP Port 162

WHAT HAPPENS WITH R1‚Äôs G0/1 INTERFACE GOES DOWN?

NOTE:

UDP message sent to Destination Port 162 (SNMP Manager)

‚Äúversion‚Äù is set to v2c

community is ‚ÄúJeremy1‚Äù (Read Only - no Set messages)

snmpV2-trap : trap message sent due to interface G0/1 going down

variable-bindings : contains the OID sent to identify the issue.

SNMP SUMMARY

- SNMP helps MANAGE DEVICES over a NETWORK
- MANAGED DEVICES are the devices being managed using SNMP (such as ROUTERS, SWITCHES, FIREWALLS)
- NETWORK MANAGEMENT STATIONS (NMS) are the SNMP ‚Äúservers‚Äù that manage the devices
    - NMS receives notifications from Managed Devices
    - NMS changes settings on Managed Devices
    - NMS checks status of Managed Devices
    
- Variables, such as Interface Status, Temperature, Traffic Load, Hostname, etc are STORED in the MANAGMENT INFORMATION BASE (MIB) and identified using Object IDs (OIDs)
